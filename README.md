## Learning AJAX

I am currently in the process of learning AJAX and this is my first attempt at implementing it on my own.
The API: [Ron Swanson Quotes](https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes/15).


## Description of assignment

*The task is to find an open and well-documented API, avoid APIs that require a key. Build a website that sends a query to the API and displays the response using fetch and DOM manipulation. 

*While the response is loading from the server, show a "data loading" message, preferably an animated gif. 

*Once the response is received from the server, remove the loading message and instead display the data from the server in a nicely formatted way using HTML and CSS. 

*The goal is to create something attractive and clever.

## Technologies

- HTML
